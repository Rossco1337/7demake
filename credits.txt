health/mp bars

it's beyond belief that health bars are probably the most universal game component but unity doesn't have any built in.
the slider is not fit for purpose because you have to hack off the handle and reset the fill every time you create one.

in-game debug console

another basic feature that should be in unity by default.
the "help" command seems to be bugged and adding commands with optional parameters seems to be impossible but it does the job.
