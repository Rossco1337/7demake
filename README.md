# 7demake
a unity game project that probably wont become anything but it's keeping me occupied.

## requirements
unity 2020.2, [in-game debug console](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/in-game-debug-console-68068) (does unity include depencies? i have no idea.)

## checklist

 - [x] classic battle scene ui
 - [x] tick system
 - [x] global timer
 - [ ] enemy encounters
 - [ ] party system
 - [ ] modern ui
 - [ ] the rest of the owl
