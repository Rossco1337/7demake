# 7demake
a unity game project that probably wont become anything but it's keeping me occupied.

## requirements
playing: a web browser with javascript enabled

editing/building: unity 2019.3

## where can i play?
[here](https://rossco1337.github.io/categories/#7demake)

manual build uploads until i can figure out cross-repo workflows. i only just realised today that people are writing these template sites in ruby.


## checklist

 - [x] classic battle scene ui
 - [x] tick system
 - [x] global timer
 - [ ] enemy encounters
 - [ ] party system
 - [ ] modern ui
 - [ ] the rest of the owl
